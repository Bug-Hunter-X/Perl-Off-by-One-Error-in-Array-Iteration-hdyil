This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Perl when iterating over arrays. The `bug.pl` file contains code that exhibits this error, while `bugSolution.pl` offers a corrected version.  The error arises from using the $#array construct to get the last index, which is problematic when the array is empty. The corrected version uses a safer method to handle iterations, preventing potential errors.
